In accordance to the mission and vision, the above figure shows the learning target and scope of the topics under this personal brand. It aims to document and share curated information from the processes and implementations along with personal insights and perspectives about the subject.

The topics are categorized into 3 main areas:

- #### Web Application Development

    Full-stack web application development involves building both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) components of a web application. Developers working on full-stack development need proficiency in various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, and back-end languages/frameworks like ASP.NET and JavaScript framework (Angular, React, etc). They are responsible for implementing features, ensuring functionality, and optimizing performance across the entire application stack.

- #### DevOps Practices

    DevOps (Development and Operations) practices focus on streamlining the software development lifecycle by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams. Automation plays a central role in DevOps, enabling processes such as continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and automated testing. DevOps practices aim to improve deployment frequency, reduce lead time for changes, and enhance the reliability and quality of software releases. Tools like Azure DevOps Server, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and Kubernetes are commonly used for implementing DevOps pipelines and automation.

- #### Cloud Infrastructures

    Cloud infrastructure and architecture involve deploying and managing applications and services on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure. Cloud architects design and implement cloud-native solutions, leveraging services like virtual machines, containers, serverless computing, databases, and networking resources. They focus on factors such as scalability, availability, security, and cost optimization when designing cloud architectures.
