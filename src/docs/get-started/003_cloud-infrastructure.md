## Cloud Service Infrastructure

Cloud Service Infrastructure refers to the collection of hardware and software components necessary to deliver cloud computing services over the internet. This infrastructure typically includes servers, storage, networking, and virtualization technologies.

Each model offers varying degrees of control, management, and customization options to users.
